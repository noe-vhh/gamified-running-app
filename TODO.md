- [ ] No token refresh mechanism for users
- [ ] Missing input validation on API endpoints

- [ ] Badge/title management endpoints (set active title, view badges)
- [ ] User profile update endpoints
- [ ] hallenge progress tracking endpoints

- [ ] Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- [ ] No soft delete functionality
- [ ] Missing audit trails for important actions

- [ ] No caching mechanism
- [ ] Missing background job processing
- [ ] Retry logic for Strava API calls

- [ ] Check momentum system
- [ ] Reason for momentum system

---

## **Tech / Backend**

- [ ] Migrate to PostgreSQL for production scaling
- [ ] Backup/restore strategy
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling & logging
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Job queue for Strava sync (Celery / RQ)
- [ ] Analytics + monitoring (retention, churn, engagement)
- [ ] CDN for images/media

---

## **Mobile Frontend**

- [ ] Expo + React Native base app (iOS + Android)
- [ ] NativeWind (Tailwind styling)
- [ ] Zustand for state management
- [ ] React Query for API sync
- [ ] Push notifications (streak reminders, friend activities, milestones)

---

## **Social**

- [ ] Friends system
- [ ] Friends discovery, search & requests
- [ ] Clubs system
- [ ] Club discovery & search
- [ ] Community System (Possibly teams etc. for non club members not wanting Solo experience)

---

## **Leaderboards**

- [ ] Solo level leaderboard (XP-based)
- [ ] Internal Club leaderboards (internal ranking of members by XP)
- [ ] Club vs. Club system (fair rules: both clubs complete same challenge)

---

## **Loop Enhancements**

- [ ] Profile viewing (Player, friends, club)
- [ ] Profile customization (themes, badges, frames)

---

## **Rewards**

- [ ] Seasonal rewards (limited badges/titles per season)
- [ ] Achievement chains (progressive milestones)
- [ ] Club trophies & banners for achievements
- [ ] Seasonal resets for club leaderboards
- [ ] Weighted scoring system so less-fit users can still contribute meaningfully
